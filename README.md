# 🌾 IoT-Based Smart Agriculture Monitoring System

This project uses IoT to automate and monitor key agricultural parameters such as **soil moisture**, **temperature**, and **humidity** using **NodeMCU ESP8266**, **DHT11**, and **soil moisture sensors**. Built as part of a 4-member team, the system aims to optimize water usage and improve crop yield through real-time data tracking via the **Blynk IoT platform**.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time monitoring of temperature, humidity, and soil moisture
- Wireless data transmission using NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
- Automated control and alerts through Blynk app dashboard
- Data-driven decision making for smarter irrigation

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Microcontroller**: NodeMCU ESP8266
- **Sensors**: DHT11, Soil Moisture Sensor
- **Programming**: C++ (Arduino IDE)
- **IoT Platform**: Blynk
- **Communication**: Wi-Fi
